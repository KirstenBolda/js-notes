## **Objects**
---

- Collections of related data and functionality  
- group of variables and functions to create a model of something from the real world  
- built-in data type
- strings and numbers can behave the same as numbers in some instances

In an Object Literal:
- unordered data is organized into key-value pairs
- **variables** become **properties**
- **functions** become **methods**
- the name is a **key** or **identifier**
  - keys are strings but don't need quotation marks around them if they have no special characters in them
- each key-value pair is a property of the object
- the **value** of a **key** can be:
   - string
   - number
   - Boolean
   - array
   - another (nested) object
   - a function (called a **method** when inside an object )

- object literal uses colons `:` to separate key/value pairs 
- commas `,` to separate properties **(Very Important! Will cause errors if these are missing!)**
- a **method** is a **property** with a **function** as its **value**
- constructor literal uses `this` instead of object name, `= `to separate key/value variables and semicolons `;` to separate properties

---
### **Create an Object using Literal Notation**

#### Object Literal Syntax
- objects are assigned to variables 
- use curly braces `{}` to designate the object literal
- fill the object with unordered data organized into key-value pairs
  - key name: the **identifier**
    - points to a location holding the value
    - the value can be any data type, including functions or other objects
- key is separated from its associated value by a colon `:`
- key-value pairs are separated by commas `,`
- keys are strings, but quotation marks can be omitted if there are no special characters or spaces in the key name
- values are strings and enclosed with quotation marks
- use a semi-colon after the closing curly brace `};`
 
*Example:*
```
 const objectName = {
     key1 : 'value1',
     key2 : 'value2',
     methodName() {
       return some code;
     }
 };

 ```
 ---
 ### **Create an Object using Constructor Notation**
 
 ```
 const objectName = new Object();
     objectName.key1 = 'value1';
     objectName.key2 = 'value2';
     objectName.methodName = function() {
       return some code;
     };
 ```
 ---
### **Including a method in an object literal**

- Create key-value pairs
- Key is the method name (*identifier*)
- Value is an anonymous function expression
- Omit colon and and `function` keyword in ES6
- Invoked by appending the object's name with the dot operator and the method name with parentheses

*Example:*
```
// pre ES6

const myObject = {
 letUsCode: function () {
   console.log('Learning about Objects!')
 }
};

// ES6 - omit colon : and `function` keyword 

const myObject = {
  letUsCode () {
    console.log('Learning about Objects!')
  }
};

myObject.letUsCode();
// returns:
Learning about Objects!
```

### Nested Objects
- objects may have other objects as properties, and those objects may also have objects within them
- chain objects to access the nested properties or methods

- use the property name and colon syntax
- use curly braces to enclose the object

  ```
  const object = {
    // this is an object property of the 'object'
    _newObject : {
      key : value,
      anotherKey : 'another value
    }
  }
  ```
---
## Accessing Properties and Methods in an Object

### Dot Notation (Member Operator) `.`

#### Dot Notation Syntax
- write name of the object
- use the dot operator `.`
- write property name (key) after the dot
- end the statement with a semicolon `;`
- if an attempting to access a property that doesn't exist operator returns `undefined`

*Example:*
   ```
   destination.name;
   ```

### Bracket Notation `[]`
- *must* use bracket notation when accessing keys that have numbers, spaces, or special characters in them
  - See above, creating an object literal, that keys with numbers, spaces or special characters will already be enclosed in quotes
- can use a variable inside the brackets to select the keys of an object
  - helpful when working with functions

#### Square Bracket Syntax
  - pass the property name (key) between brackets `[]` as a string enclosed in quotation marks `''`
  - used when a variable is used in place of a property name
  - end with a semi-colon `;`

*Example:*
```
destination['name'];
```


### Modifying Key-Value Pairs
- objects are mutable
- if the property already exists, the new value will replace the existing one
- if there is no property with that name, a new property will be added to the object

#### Property Assignment Syntax
- Dot Notation/Assignment Operator: `.`

   `objectName.property = 'newValue';`

- Bracket Notation: `[]`

  `objectName['Property Change'] = 'newValue';`

- delete a property with the `delete `operator

   `delete objectName.property;`  
  Or:  
   `delete objectName['property two'];`

- clear the value of the property without deleting the property key  

  `objectName.property = '';`

#### `this` keyword
  - object that a method belongs to is called the calling object
  - `this` references the calling object and provides access to its properties when the object's property would otherwise be outside the scope of the method
  - every JavaScript function or method has a `this` context
  - for a function defined inside of an object, `this` will refer to that object itself
  - for a function defined outside of an object, `this` will refer to the global object (`window` in a browser, `global` in Node.js
  - avoid using arrow functions with the `this` keyword, as arrow functions inherently bind, or tie, an already defined `this` value to the function itself that is NOT the calling object. 

#### `Object.keys()` function
 - return a list of an object's properties/keys

    `Object.keys(objectName);`

 #### `Object.assign()` function
 - copies all properties from one object to another

     `Object.assign(source, target);`

#### Iterating through Objects
- use `for ... in` syntax
- can be used to iterate over the keys of an object 
- one of the properties from the object is assigned to the variable of that loop in each iteration 
*Example:*
```
for (let variableName in outerObject.innerObject) {
  console.log(`${variableName}: ${outerObject.innerObject[variableName].propertyName}`)
};
```

#### Privacy in Objects
- only certain properties should be mutable or able to change in value
-  place an underscore `_ `before the name of a property that should not be altered.

### Passing Objects as Arguments
- when objects are passed as arguments to functions or methods, they are **passed by reference**, not by value
- primitive data types are passed by value and not mutable
- means that the object itself (not a copy) is accessible and **mutable** (can be changed) inside that function

### Looping through objects using `for...in`
- executes a block of code for every property in an object
- assign a variable for a key in the object's property
- loop through the object keys using that variable

*Example:* (from Codecademy course)

```
let spaceship = {
    crew: {
    captain: { 
        name: 'Lily', 
        degree: 'Computer Engineering', 
        cheerTeam() { console.log('You got this!') } 
        },
    'chief officer': { 
        name: 'Dan', 
        degree: 'Aerospace Engineering', 
        agree() { console.log('I agree, captain!') } 
        },
    medic: { 
        name: 'Clementine', 
        degree: 'Physics', 
        announce() { console.log(`Jets on!`) } },
    translator: {
        name: 'Shauna', 
        degree: 'Conservation Science', 
        powerFuel() { console.log('The tank is full!') } 
        }
    }
}; 

for (let crewMember in spaceship.crew) {
  console.log(`${crewMember} : ${spaceship.crew[crewMember].name}`)
};

// logs:
captain : Lily
chief officer : Dan
medic : Clementine
translator : Shauna

for (let crewMember in spaceship.crew) {
  console.log(`${crewMember} : ${spaceship.crew[crewMember].degree}`)
};

// logs:
captain : Computer Engineering
chief officer : Aerospace Engineering
medic : Physics
translator : Conservation Science
```


### Getter Method
- getter is the publicly accessible version of a property
- use the `get` keyword followed by a function (method)
- use `this` keyword to access the object's internal properties (the `_` prepended property)
- can perform an action on the data when getting a property
- can return different values using conditionals
- easier for other developers to understand
- don't need to be called with parentheses (so they look the same as properties when called)
- properties cannot share the same name as the getter/setter function-will result in an infinite call stack error

*Example:*  
```
// the object containing a getter method
const person = {
  _firstName: 'Jane',
  _lastName: 'Smart',

  // ----the getter method starts---- //
 get fullName() {
    if (this._firstName && this._lastName){
      return `${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`;
    } else {
      return 'Missing a first name or a last name.';
    }
  // ----the getter method ends---- //
  }
  // To call the getter method: 
person.fullName; // 'Jane Smart'
  ```

#### Setter Method
- reassign values of existing properties within an object
- used to respect the intention of properties prepended with `_`
- all setters need at least one parameter
- benefits to using setter method:
   - checking input
   - ability to perform actions on properties
   - clear intention for object's purpose
- do not need to be called with a set of parentheses (assigned value becomes method's parameter)
- syntax for a setter looks the same as reassigning the value of a property

*Example:*  
```
// the object containing a setter method
const person = {
  _age: 37,
  // ----the setter method starts---- //
  set age(newAge){
    if (typeof newAge === 'number'){
      this._age = newAge;
    } else {
      console.log('You must assign a number to age');
    }
  }
  // ----the setter method ends---- //
};

// calling the setter method
person.age = 40;
```


#### Factory Functions
- returns an object 
- can be reused to make multiple object instances
- may have parameters that customize the returned object

*Example:*
```
const widgetFactory = (paramA, paramB) => {
  return {
    paramA: paramA,
    paramB: paramB,
    methodSample() {
      //some code here using paramX
    }
  }
};

//--call the widgetFactory function to make a widget object --//

const majorWidget = widgetFactory('widgetA', 'widgetB', 'paramX');

//-- returns a widget object with these parameters:--//

const majorWidget = {
  paramA : 'widgetA',
  paramB : 'widgetB',
  methodSample(paramX) {
    //some code here using paramX
  }
};
```

#### Destructuring: Property Value Shorthand (ES6)
- shortcut for assigning properties to variables in a factory function (ES6)
- property value shorthand: when the property's key and value share the same name remove the` key :` portion to destructure the object

#### Destructured Assignment
- create a variable that matches the name of an object’s key, 
- wrap it in curly braces `{ }` and assign to it the object  
*Example:*  
 *(before destructuring)*  
   `const newVariable = obj.propertyName`  
   `// newVariable = propertyValue`  

  *(after destructuring)*  
   **variable name needs to be exactly the same as the property name in the object**   
    `const {newVariable} = obj;`  
    `console.log(newVariable);`  
    `// prints propertyValue`
#### Array.from
 -  convert a collection of items in an object to a real array   
 ```
 let arrayish = {0: "one", 1: "two", length: 2};
 let array = Array.from(arrayish);
 console.log(array);
 // output is: [ 'one', 'two' ]
 ```
#### Built-in Object Methods
- methods built into all JavaScript objects

Link to [MDN's Object Instance Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object#Methods)

*Examples:*
- `Object.assign()`: Copies the values of properties from one or more source objects to a target object
  
  -  *Example:*  
     - `const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);`
    
  - *Example:*
     - target values can be entered as [key, value] pairs
     - `const newObject = Object.assign({attribute1: true, color: azure}, sourceObject);`
- `Object.entries()`: Returns an array containing all of the [key, value] pairs of a given object's string properties  

- `Object.keys()`: Returns an array containing the names of all the object's string properties

## Console Object
  - Method
     - `.log()` - information inside the parentheses will get printed, or logged, to the console.  


![worm creature](../img/worm-creature.svg)
## Document Object
  - tree-like structure that organizes the elements on a web page and allows scripting languages to access them
  -  the `document` keyword points to the root node of the Document Object Model (DOM), `<html>`
  #### Properties:

  - `.documentElement` : refers to the object representing the `<html>` tag
  - `.head` and `.body` : for these elements that are present on every web page
  - `.innerHTML` : access and set the contents of an element
  - `.style` : used to access the inline style of an HTML tag
      - use camelCase for style properties instead of hyphens
      - values of the properties are strings (enclose in apostrophes)
  - `.hidden` : hides the selected element by assigning it as `true` or `false`  
     - **not** the same as setting the CSS visibility property to `hidden`
  - `.onclick` : assign a function to run on a click event on an element
  -  `.firstChild` : access to the first child of that parent element
  - `.parentNode` : access the parent element of the variable 
  - `.childNodes` : holds an array-like object, with a `length` property and properties labeled by numbers to access the child node
  - `.children`  : contains only element nodes, not text nodes
  - `.nodeValue`  : holds the string of text the node represents
  - **Accessing Size and Position in JavaScript:**
      - `offsetWidth`
      - `offsetHeight`
      - `clientWidth`
      - `clientHeight`
      - `getBoundingClientRect`
   
  #### Methods:
  - `.querySelector()` : used to specify a CSS selector and then return the first element that matches the selector
     - selector can be a tag `<></>`, a `.class` or `#id`
  - `.querySelectorAll()` : returns a `NodeList` containing all the matching elements
     - returned object is not live
     - use `Array.from` to convert to an array
  - `.getElementsByTagName(` : collects all elements with the given tag name that are descendants (direct or indirect children) of that node and returns them as an array-like object'
  - `.getElementsByClassName()` : searches through the contents of an element node and retrieves all elements that have the given string in their `class` attribute
  - `.getElementByID()` : used to access elements directly by their id
  - `.createElement(tagName)` : creates a new element based on the specified tag name passed into it as an argument
      - creates an empty element with no inner HTML
      - **process appending:** assign created element to be the child of an element that already exists on the DOM
  - `.appendChild()` : add a child element as the last child node
  - `.removeChild()` : removes a specified child node from a parent node
  - `.replaceChild()`  : used to replace one child node with another
    - a new node and the node to be replaced as arguments
    - expects the new node as its first argument
  - `.createTextNode()`  : removes an images and adds a new text node to replace it
  - `.getAttribute()` : access an element by its attribute name, used for not commonly used, non-standard attributes created by the programmer
     - recommended that nons-standard attributes be prefixed with `data-` to distinguish them from standard attribues
     - `class` attribute is accessed under `className` in JavaScript
     - use `getAttribute` to access it under `class`
